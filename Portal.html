      <p>Using the gun to their advantage, players must solve test chambers at Aperture science under the watchful eye of GLaDOS, an AI build to maintain the facility.
      Accoridng to Portal's <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)><i>Wikipedia Page</i></a>, the game uses ideas from <i><b>Narbacular Drop</b></i>
      , which was the prototype for this game. Most of the staff that worked on <i><b>Narbacular Drop</b></i> ended up getting hired at Valve in order to further their prototype, which became Portal.</P>
<!--Portal does share some similarities to narbacular drop, however it's not a direct sequel to narbacular drop -->
